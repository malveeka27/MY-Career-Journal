My Career Journal

Your AI-powered career companion - guiding you step by step from career discovery to skill building, interview preparation, and tracking your growth.

Inspiration

Choosing the right career path and building the skills for it can be overwhelming. Most platforms are either too generic or confusing, leaving people unsure where to start. We wanted to create a tool that feels like a personal mentor and friend, walking with you throughout your career journey.

What it does

Career Journal provides end-to-end career guidance through three main components:

Career Suggestor

Users enter their skills and aptitude score (or take a free test).

The system suggests the top 5 career paths suited for them.

Career Developer

Explore careers in depth: roles, responsibilities, tools, top companies, and trends.

AI-powered Resume Parser extracts details (skills, education, experience).

Skill Gap Analyzer compares current skills with desired roles and provides curated learning resources.

Interview Preparation

Generates the most common interview questions for the chosen career.

Helps users practice, gain confidence, and be ready for real interviews.

Career Tracker

Functions like a career journal: track progress, log milestones, set reminders, and reflect on growth over time.
